# Deep-learning-internship
This project implements a 1D Convolutional Neural Network as a deepl learning model for classifying EEG Signals Generated as simulations with Matlab.
EEG ( Electroencephalography ) An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to your scalp.
Few Data Preprocessing Techniques are used to order, normalize and standarize the data.
